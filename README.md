📈 Sales Forecasting


This repository contains a Sales Forecasting project where we analyze past sales data and build predictive models using advanced machine learning and time series forecasting techniques like SARIMAX, Exponential Smoothening, LightGBM.


📝 Overview

This project focuses on forecasting sales trends using a combination of traditional statistical methods and modern machine learning models. The goal is to identify patterns, seasonality, and trends to make accurate sales predictions.

🔍 Key Features


Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Time Series Analysis
Feature Engineering
Model Training & Evaluation using:
SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables)
LightGBM (Gradient Boosting for Time Series Forecasting)

⚙️ Installation & Requirements


To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or install the essential libraries manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels lightgbm


🚀 Usage

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting.git
cd sales-forecasting

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook aryan_sales_forecasting.ipynb

Follow the notebook to explore the data, train models, and forecast sales.

📊 Model Performance

The models are evaluated using:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

🏆 Best Model Selection

Based on the evaluation metrics, the best-performing model is chosen for final sales forecasting.
